# Bash Script

This is a repository of studies on bash scripts and also a library of my own bash scripts that I have found useful.

## Organization

Here you will find several bash script directories, each with its own uses. Feel free to explore them.

- [File Permissions Listing](./list-permissions/readme.md)
- [Script Conversor MP4 para MP3](./mp4-to-mp3-converter/readme.md)
